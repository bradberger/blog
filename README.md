# Personal Blog

This is the code for my personal blog at [bradb.net](//bradb.net).
It's statically generated using [Hugo](//gohugo.io). It's optimized for
performance, including delivering of
[above-the-fold CSS](http://addyosmani.com/blog/detecting-critical-above-the-fold-css-with-paul-kinlan-video/)
inline. Basic JavaScript is delivered inline, as well.

Use it as a basis for your next blog if your interested in a high performance,
statically generated, [GulpJS](//gulpjs.org) blog, static website, web app, or
hybrid app.
