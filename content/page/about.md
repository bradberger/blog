Thanks for stopping by!

Work-wise, I'm a full-stack web software engineer. I focus on interesting,
small projects and try to write good code. Good code should be small, simple,
readable, orthogonal. Simplicity and readability of code should be one of the
highest priorities of any developer.

Most of the software and tools I use every day are open source, and as such,
it seems important to try to give back to the community that makes all that
possible. Hence, I'm an active open source contributor and am currently
working on some cool open source projects.

A sample of projects and websites I've worked on is coming down the pipe
pretty soon, so feel free to ask about them in the meantime. The best place
to check out some of the stuff I'm currently working on at any given time
is [Github](//github.com/bradberger).
