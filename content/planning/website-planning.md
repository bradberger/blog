# Website Planning, Part 1

## Overview

This is the first in a series of posts that overviews website planning.
It's quite simple even for non-technical users to create their own websites.
Getting the desired results requires a lot of planning and teamwork.

This series is as a broad overview of the process of developing a website.
It does not attempt to touch on the technical aspects of doing so, as those
are best dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Personally, I use it as a reference for new prospective clients to understand
the challenges and the process that awaits. This provides a realistic overview
of the many details involved without needing to reproduce those details in
email form.

This post will focus on the the general planning process. It touches on the
need to plan, types of content needed, and talent (people) that will need to
be brought on board.


### Who This Is For

The content here-in is primarily targeted for:

- Small and medium-sized businesses

- Small and medium-sized organizations and institutions

The needs of individuals or large companies are entirely different. They
will likely find the content here far too detailed, or not nearly detailed
enough.


## Why Plan

Building a website requires a long-term outlook. It requires:

- Detailed planning
- Good coordination between many different people
- Regular maintenance and attention
- A reasonable budget

Anyone who's not ready to invest in the site by ensuring those basic building
blocks are in place will experience many long-term issues
that end up costing more time, money, and stress than are necessary.


### Building a House As An Example

Building a website can likened to building a house. How so?
Consider the following:

- Long-term project
- Requires significant planning
- Must be maintained
- Involves many different variables
- Is not one-size-fits-all
- Direct relationship to quality of process and materials to end-result


### The Value of Planning and Needs Assessment

It's quite common for a prospective client to want an estimate early on in
the process. If I were in their shoes, I would too. Some have a general idea of
what they want already. Others simply point to a competitor's website and say
"I want something like that, only better". Still others already have several
pages of details regarding what they need. While a ballpark figure in those
cases is possible, much more information is needed to arrive at an accurate
cost and schedule.

That's why it pays in the long run to hire a developer or project manager to
do a thorough needs assessment before starting. Understandably, those who are
new to the process might not initially understand the need for such a process.
Perhaps they may view it as a extra burden on either time or budget. The
reality is that it does not make a project take longer, nor does it
increase overall cost. A couple of days spent on a needs assessment can
save a couple of weeks in extended development time and increased costs &mdash;
both of which were avoidable.

The old adage goes "If something is worth doing, it's worth doing right".
As related to building a website, this is especially true. If a potential
client's thought is "I just need a website, it doesn't have to be anything
special" than they may not really need a website after all. Or they may not
really be ready to go down that path quite yet. That's fine, of course.
Realizing that from the outset will help save both the client and the
developer a lot of frustration.

### Common Results of Failing To Plan

If a person or organization decides they need to jump on the bandwagon and
have a website just for the sake of having a website, the results are poor.
No one should expect a good result from a process that is hurried,
under-planned, and under-budgeted.

Consider the following example:

> Client: I want you to build me a house.
>
> Builder: What kind of house would you like?
>
> Homeowner: It should be roomy and well-built. I only have $5,000 to
> spend on it. It needs to be done in one week.
>
> Builder: Okay, I'll start on it tomorrow.

It goes without saying that the result will be a disaster.

In the case of a website, failing to plan adequately will lead to:

- The designer or developer being forced to make assumptions, some or many
  of which will be wrong, wasting time and causing frustration from both sides.

- Increased back-and-forth communication about trivial matters, greatly slowing
  down progress and affecting deadlines.

- Out of scope work that causes the project to run over-budget

- Confusion and dissatisfaction from both parties, potentially leading one
  party to lose interest and/or abandon the project.

## Step 1 - Goals, Conversions, and Audience

We'll discuss the various roles involved in the making of a site shortly.
Keep in mind for now, though, that the work done by everyone must be based on
an understanding of the target audience and the desired result.

Every website should have conversions. A conversion is an event which signals
that the goal of the website has been achieved. For an e-commerce site that may
be a product purchase. For an agency, perhaps an a end-user inquiry.

Without a clear concept of the definition of success the work by all involved
will likely be wasted. The website won't bring the desired results. So start
by clearly defining what the website should accomplish. This is a crucial step
to helping all involved to contribute to the success of the project.


### Know Your Audience

A crucial step in the process is to identify your audience. A common mistake
is assuming everyone is your audience. That's very rarely the case. If you're
selling women's clothes your audience will differ greatly than the audience
of the organization behind open-source, embedded operating system.

We'll cover this later on, too, but knowing your audience is a key aspect of
planning content. Optimizing for search engines is a great idea. People will
find your content via a search engine only when they're searching for
something. It's an obvious, but somewhat under-appreciated, fact.

Knowing your target audience is the first step in understanding
their search patterns. Understanding what they're looking for will enable you
to produce great content that meets their needs.


## Step 2 - Needs Assessment

To be successful, the website must fit with the overall marketing plan.
For a new business or organization, the needs of the website might blur the
lines with the overall marketing needs of the business. Which is acceptable,
but nonetheless must be taken into account.

Every website needs content. This may include:

- Text (and usually a lot of it)
- Branding (logo, color palettes, fonts, etc.)
- Images
- Documents
- Audio
- Video
- Photos
- Social media feeds

### Team Members

To deliver the needed content mentioned above, there are roles to be
filled. Depending on the size of the organization, one person may play
more than one role. Regardless of that, these roles must be clearly defined
and all who play a role must communicate closely to make the project succeed.

While every project is different, basic roles include:

- Stakeholders;
- Project manager;
- Copywriter and/or editor;
- Web designer (graphics, illustrations, web design);
- Social media manager;
- HTML coder (HTML, CSS, JavaScript);
- Web developer (CMS, server side coding);
- System administrator (Managing the platform, servers, etc.);

The overall outcome will depend greatly on the combined skill of all involved.
This is a case where the chain really is only as strong as it's weakest link.
A great design without great copy won't work. Awesome copy without a solid
content management system is futile. All those parts without someone to keep
an eye on the servers means the content won't reach it's audience.

Depending on the size of the organization, and the talent withing, many of
these roles may need to be outsourced. Doing so obviously increases the cost
and initial complexity of the project. Nonetheless, not giving attention to
keep the quality high in any of those areas will greatly compromise the project.


## Summary

Hopefully, at the end of part one of this series, you'll be convinced that
building a website is not a simple task. It's a serious commitment which
requires careful planning.

If you've come to the conclusion that it's still right for your company or
organization, there are no doubt a lot more questions to be answered, like:

- What is a needs assesment? What should it cover?
- What kind of content should my site have?
- How can I develop content that will appeal to my audience and drive
  conversions?
- How does the design process work?
- Who should design my website?
- What technical features should the site have?
- What is involved in maintaining a site once it's built?

These are just a few questions that we'll address in future articles in this
series. We'll also attempt to break down what each person in the various
technical roles do. This will you to know what to look for when hiring, and
what to expect from them. Understanding what they do will also help you to
understand how you can work with them to get the best result. We'll discuss
the roles of:

- Copywriter and/or editor;
- Designer (graphics, illustrations, web design);
- HTML coder (HTML, CSS, JavaScript);
- Web developer (CMS, server side coding);
- System administrator (Managing the platform, servers, etc.);
