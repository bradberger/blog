Writing good software means testing it thoroughly. It should be reliable and delivered as bug-free as possible. There's nothing more frustrating than a brand-new release that has serious or multiple issues.

Often times, it's easy for a freelance developer to let the QA process slide a bit. There are many reasons for this, including a rush to a deadline, the general boringness of testing, and more.

None of those reasons, though, are an exuse to not make the QA process rock-solid and to actually do it for each release.

# Dedicated QA Testing

In an effort to continually improve the development process, we're introducing dedicated QA testing and a new QA tester. 

Meet Ivan Lichovski.

Ivan is a current computer science student, and has a great background in HTML, PHP, and more. He's diligent, and pays attention to detail. He'll be handling all QA sessions.

# Session Workflow

For each session, we'll be testing everything, including:

1. Usability
2. Bugs
3. Cross-browser compatibility
4. Mobile device compatibility

For convenience, we'll often work remotely, but will also work together in the office when needed. All sessions will be recorded and tracked via [JIRA capture](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/capture). This will allow detailed reports about the type of tests done, great integrated issue tracking, and lots of data about each issue - screenshots, links, comments, and more.

# Conclusion

Since the QA testing can be delivered at a lower price rate than development itself, we'll be more than doubling the QA time for each project/release, while at the same time reducing the cost for each project. It's a win-win for everybody involved.

So look forward to more thoroughly tested, bug-free experiences, starting today!
