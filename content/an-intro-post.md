Welcome to the new blog! All the previous content has been send out to pasture. Some of it may find it's way back in, but much of it won't.

First off, a big thanks to the team at [Ghost](//ghost.org) for the awesome blogging platform. It's powering this site, and it's a pleasure to use.

What's in store for this tiny section of the web? Read on below.

# More Than a Fresh Coat of Paint

In an effort to contribute to the abundant, high-quality web tech blogging and instructional scene, this blog is going through a complete reboot. More frequent, detailed, fact-checked articles and collaboration with industry leaders ahead!

## Functional Code Samples

All code published here will have it's own [Gist](gist.github.com) or [JSBin](//jsbin.com) examples to go with it, so it's completely functional and can be used right from the start. This simple step should greatly increase the quality of the code samples and make them more useful out of the box.

## Collaboration

When it comes to different approaches on various subjects, it's always helpful to call in other seasoned developers to give their thoughts and methods. Every article, where possible, will include collaboration with experts in the given field. When articles or posts need this collaboration, they will be marked with [DRAFT] in the title.

If you have something you would like to write about, please feel free to [get in touch](/about). Let's talk about it and make it happen!

## Fact Checking

It's important to be able to trust the information you read from any given source. To achieve a level of reliability, every post and article will undergo at least several rounds of fact checking, and will include all references at the end of the post. This should greatly increase confidence in the material by vastly improving it's realiablity.

## Real-World Scenarios

It's one thing to write code in school, or under lab-perfect situations. The reality of the real-world, however, is not so cut and dry. So articles will try have a realistic approach, taking into consideration the reality of the workplace.

We'll also try to focus on a lot of best practices and general ideas that can make day-to-day work more productive and effective.

## Limited Framework Code

While modern frameworks have a great deal to offer, we'll try to limit the amount of code and articles related to any "framework" way of doing things, and instead prefer to rely on raw language implementations of any given idea.

That's not to say that there won't be posts on jQuery, etc., but they will be more limited in scope. This won't be a jQuery or WordPress how-to resource.

# Fresh Content

The web is an exciting place. Technology changes every day. We'll try to keep up with it by offering fresh, insightful comments and tutorials with the latest technologies and best practices first and foremost. This will not be a place where articles are just rehashed and served up again.
